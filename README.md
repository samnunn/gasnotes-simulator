# Gas Notes Simulator ðŸ˜´

**The [Gas Notes Simulator][gasnotes-sim] is a remote-controlled bedside monitor.**

Simulation is a great way to build strengths and find weaknesses in your self, your team, and your system without all the headaches of putting patients in harmâ€™s way.

This software was created so that simulation tools would be freely available to all.

## Usage
The Gas Notes Simulator is designed to be *reasonably* self-explanatory to the non-technical user.

<p align="center"><b><a href="https://sim.gasnotes.net">You can check out the Gas Notes Simulator online right now!</a></b></p>

From the homepage, visitors are presented with two options: start a new sim or join an existing one (with a SimCode). Success in either option brings users to a sim's landing page, which prompts users to connect devices and then choose from "monitor" and "controller" modes on each.

Facilitators have the opportunity to adjust:

- Heart rate
- ECG morphology
- Blood pressure (SBP, DBP and MAP)
- Arterial line morphology
- Respiratory rate
- SpO<sub>2</sub>
- Plethysmograph morphology
- etCO<sub>2</sub>
- Capnograph morphology

Pending changes are stored and sent *en bloc* at the user's request. There are options to gradually transition parameters and enable/disable traces as desired.

## Architecture
The Gas Notes Simulator uses a client-server architecture to avoid all the headaches of P2P connection in potentially-hostile corporate networks. That means that **the [hosted version][gasnotes-sim] requires an internet connection**.

</p>

The server component is written in Python using the excellent [Flask][flask] framework. Message passing between clients and the server is done with WebSockets via [SocketIO][socketio] (made easy in Flask with [Flask-SocketIO][flask-socketio]).

### Persistence
For the sake of simplicity, each active SimCode is stored as a text file in `./sim_rooms`. Files with an `mtime` more than 60 minutes ago are periodically pruned by `sim-cleaner.py`.

## Self-Hosting
The [hosted version][gasnotes-sim] runs happily on the smallest [DigitalOcean Droplet](https://m.do.co/c/5248daea7efd) (affiliate link). If you are looking to host your own, check out the [sysadmin notes](sysadmin/SYSADMIN.md).
